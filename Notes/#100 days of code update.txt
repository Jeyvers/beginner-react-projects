I got so busy two days ago and forgot to tweet my update on the #100DaysOfCode as I said I would. 
I've learnt a lot so far, on my React journey. On the top of list is the fact that React makes JavaScript easier and more interesting to work with. I have issues comprehending its error setup, however, I believe I would understand as I practice.
Summary of concepts learnt so far:
- Basics (rendering, jsx and its rules, nested components, react tools, react events, props, deploying, etc)
- Advanced (Hooks: useState, useEffect, conditional rendering, working with forms, useRef, useReducer, prop drilling, context API /useContext. 
- Current level (React Router)

I encoutered difficulties understanding useReducer. Attached is an image of one of the projects built during the course (I might upload some others).
